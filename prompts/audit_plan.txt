I want to clean this codebase and prepare it for UI overhaul.
Specifically:

- Identify unused functions or dead code
- Detect mocks or placeholder data/functions
- Find all TODO, FIXME, or hacky shortcuts
- List components that arenâ€™t wired to the UI
- Point out duplicate code blocks
- Suggest cleanup and refactor priorities

Summarize results clearly, grouped by category and file.
