    "raw_text": "Here's a consolidated version of the findings, prioritized by severity:\n\n**Critical Issues (Priority: CRITICAL)**\n\n1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: The scripts use `curl` without proper error handling or input validation, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\t* File: audit.sh\n2. **LM Studio API Access**: The script checks if LM Studio is running but does not handle cases where the API might be temporarily unavailable or under heavy load.\n\t* File: send_to_lm_studio()\n3. **Potential Data Exposure**: Sensitive information such as API keys and passwords are stored in plain text, which could lead to data exposure.\n\t* File: easy_install.sh\n\n**High Priority Concerns (Priority: HIGH)**\n\n1. **System Crashes**: The scripts use `timeout` but do not handle the case where the timeout is exceeded, which could lead to system crashes.\n\t* File: audit.sh\n2. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The script does not properly handle errors that might occur during the analysis process.\n\t* File: send_to_lm_studio()\n\n**Technical Debt & TODOs (Priority: MEDIUM)**\n\n1. **Missing Tests**: There are no tests for the scripts, which makes it difficult to ensure their correctness and maintainability.\n\t* File: audit.sh\n2. **Code Duplication**: The script contains duplicated code that can be extracted into a separate function or module.\n\t* File: gen_claude_prompt()\n3. **Magic Numbers**: The script contains magic numbers (e.g., `120`, `4096`) that are not clearly explained.\n\t* File: send_to_lm_studio()\n\n**Actionable Recommendations**\n\n1. Implement proper error handling and input validation in the `curl` commands.\n2. Store sensitive information securely, such as using environment variables or a secrets manager.\n3. Add tests for the scripts to ensure their correctness and maintainability.\n4. Simplify the codebase by removing unused functions and redundant code.\n5. Optimize minor aspects of the scripts, such as using more efficient data structures or algorithms.\n6. Implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff for LM Studio API access.\n7. Improve error handling mechanisms, such as logging errors and providing detailed feedback.\n8. Extract duplicated code into a separate function or module.\n9. Define named constants for magic numbers.\n\n**Estimated Impact**: High\n**Estimated Effort**: Medium",
