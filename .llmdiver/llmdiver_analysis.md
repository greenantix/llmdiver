## Executive Summary

This may indicate that the repository is not a traditional codebase or has been intentionally cleared of code. Given this context, our analysis will focus on potential security implications and provide recommendations for future development.

### Medium Priority Issues (2)
- 1. **Repository Cleanup**: Determine the purpose of the repository and either add valid code files or consider deleting it.
- 2. **Dependency Security**: If dependencies are added in the future, ensure they are properly secured and reviewed for potential vulnerabilities.
