This may indicate that the repository is incomplete, misconfigured, or intentionally designed without source code. Given this situation, there are no critical issues to report, but we will outline potential next steps and recommendations.\n\n## Critical Issues (Priority: CRITICAL)\nNone\n\n## High Priority Concerns (Priority: HIGH)\nNone\n\n## Technical Debt & TODOs (Priority: MEDIUM)\n- **Repository Configuration**: Review the repository configuration files (e.g., `.gitignore`, `pom.xml`) to ensure they are correctly set up and not filtering out code.\n- **Code Presence**: Investigate why no valid code files were found. If intentional, consider adding placeholder or example code for analysis purposes.\n\n## Dead Code & Optimization (Priority: LOW)\nNone\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\n1. **Verify Repository Integrity**:\n\t* Check the repository's configuration and ignore patterns to ensure they are not filtering out code.\n\t* Verify that the repository is correctly set up and configured.\n2. **Add Placeholder or Example Code**:\n\t* If the repository is intentionally empty, consider adding placeholder or example code for analysis purposes.\n3. **Re-evaluate Analysis Instructions**:\n\t* Given the lack of code, re-assess the analysis instructions and adjust them accordingly.\n\nNote: Due to the absence of valid code files, this analysis focuses on potential next steps and recommendations rather than providing in-depth findings.",
