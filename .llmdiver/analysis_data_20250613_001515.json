    "raw_text": "Here's a consolidated version of the findings, prioritized by severity:\n\n**Critical Issues (Priority: CRITICAL)**\n\n1. **Insecure Use of Environment Variables**: The `send_to_lm_studio` function uses environment variables like `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_TEMP`, and `LM_URL` directly in JSON payloads without proper validation or sanitization, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities.\n2. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The code does not handle errors properly, especially when interacting with external services like LM Studio, which may exit abruptly without providing useful error messages or logging critical information.\n3. **Potential Data Exposure**: Sensitive data (e.g., API keys) is generated and stored in environment variables or files that might not be properly secured.\n\n**High Priority Concerns (Priority: HIGH)**\n\n1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: The scripts use `curl` to connect to a local server at `http://localhost:1234`, which may expose the system to security risks if not properly configured.\n2. **Potential Data Exposure**: The `send_to_claude.sh` script sends tasks to Claude without validating user input, potentially leading to data exposure or unauthorized access.\n3. **Performance Bottlenecks**: The code uses `curl` and `jq` extensively, which might introduce performance bottlenecks due to the overhead of these tools.\n\n**Technical Debt & TODOs (Priority: MEDIUM)**\n\n1. **Missing Tests**: The code lacks comprehensive testing, making it difficult to ensure the correctness and reliability of the analysis results.\n2. **Code Smells**: The code contains some code smells, such as long functions or complex conditional statements, which can make it harder to maintain or understand.\n3. **Refactoring Opportunities**: The code has opportunities for refactoring, such as extracting separate modules for analysis and reporting tasks.\n\n**Dead Code & Optimization (Priority: LOW)**\n\n1. **Unused Functions**: The code contains unused functions or variables that can be removed to improve maintainability and reduce clutter.\n2. **Minor Optimizations**: The code has opportunities for minor optimizations, such as using more efficient data structures or algorithms.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations**\n\n1. Implement secure environment variable handling.\n2. Improve error handling mechanisms.\n3. Secure sensitive data storage.\n4. Optimize performance-critical code.\n5. Refactor code for maintainability.\n6. Add comprehensive testing to ensure correctness and reliability of analysis results.\n7. Remove unused functions or variables.\n8. Perform minor optimizations to improve efficiency.\n\nEstimated Impact: High\nEstimated Effort: Medium-High",
