## Critical Issues (Priority: CRITICAL)
None found due to lack of code.

## High Priority Concerns (Priority: HIGH)
None found due to lack of code.

## Technical Debt & TODOs (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. **Repository Configuration**: Review and adjust repomix configuration to ensure it accurately reflects the repository's contents.
2. **Code Presence**: Investigate why no valid code files are present in the repository, considering factors like misconfiguration, intentional design, or incomplete project setup.

## Dead Code & Optimization (Priority: LOW)
None found due to lack of code.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. **Verify Repository Contents**: Double-check that the repository is not intentionally designed without source code and that there are no hidden or incorrectly configured files.
