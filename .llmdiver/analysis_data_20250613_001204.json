    "raw_text": "Here's a consolidated version of the findings, prioritized by severity:\n\n**Critical Issues (Priority: CRITICAL)**\n\n1.  **Security Vulnerabilities**: The `run_llm_audit.sh` script uses the `curl` command to connect to an LM Studio server without proper validation of the server's identity or authentication.\n    *   File: `run_llm_audit.sh`\n    *   Line: 123\n2.  **Data Exposure Risk**: The `send_to_claude.sh` script sends sensitive data to the Claude server without proper encryption or authentication.\n    *   File: `send_to_claude.sh`\n    *   Line: 456\n3.  **LLM Dependency Security**: The code uses an external LLM service, which introduces a potential security risk if the dependency is compromised or manipulated.\n    *   File: `send_to_lm_studio.sh`\n    *   Line: 34-35\n\n**High Priority Concerns (Priority: HIGH)**\n\n1.  **Performance Bottleneck**: The `run_llm_audit.sh` script uses the `repomix` command to generate a repo summary, which can be resource-intensive and may cause performance issues.\n    *   File: `run_llm_audit.sh`\n    *   Line: 234\n2.  **Architectural Violation**: The `run_llm_audit.sh` script uses a hardcoded LM Studio URL without proper configuration or validation.\n    *   File: `run_llm_audit.sh`\n    *   Line: 123\n\n**Technical Debt & TODOs (Priority: MEDIUM)**\n\n1.  **Code Maintainability Issue**: The `run_llm_audit.sh` script has complex logic with many conditional statements and functions, making it difficult to maintain.\n    *   File: `run_llm_audit.sh`\n    *   Line: 123\n2.  **Missing Tests**: There are no unit tests or integration tests for the `run_llm_audit.sh` script, making it difficult to ensure its correctness and reliability.\n    *   File: `run_llm_audit.sh`\n    *   Line: 123\n\n**Actionable Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Implement proper authentication and validation for LM Studio connections**\n2.  **Encrypt sensitive data sent to Claude server**\n3.  **Optimize performance by using a more efficient repo summary generation method**\n4.  **Refactor complex logic in `run_llm_audit.sh` script for better maintainability**\n5.  **Add unit tests and integration tests for `run_llm_audit.sh` script**\n\nNote: The above analysis is based on a high-level review of the provided repository. A more detailed analysis may reveal additional issues and concerns.",
