Check for potential issues with file naming conventions, encoding, or other factors that might be causing the analysis tool to miss code files.\n\n## Dead Code & Optimization (Priority: LOW)\nNone\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\n1. **Verify Repository Integrity**: Ensure the repository is complete and correctly configured by checking for missing or incorrectly named files.\n2. **Re-run Analysis with Adjusted Configuration**: If necessary, adjust the `repomix` configuration to include more file patterns or relax ignore rules to capture code files.\n3. **Investigate Language-Specific Patterns**: Once valid code files are identified, apply language-specific best practices and common issue detection to ensure the codebase is secure and maintainable.\n\n**Estimated Effort:** Low (configuring repository settings) to Medium (investigating language-specific patterns)\n\n**Impact:** High (ensuring a complete and accurate analysis of the codebase)",
