Consider adding a dependency management system or reviewing existing package managers to ensure security best practices are followed.\n\n## Dead Code & Optimization (Priority: LOW)\nNone applicable due to lack of code files.\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\n1. **Re-evaluate Repository Purpose**: Determine if the repository is intended for a specific purpose, such as storing configuration files or documentation.\n2. **Add Sample Code or Documentation**: If the repository is meant to be a codebase, consider adding sample code or documentation to provide context and facilitate analysis.\n3. **Implement Dependency Management**: Introduce a dependency management system (e.g., pip, npm) to ensure secure package usage and versioning.\n4. **Review Repository Configuration**: Adjust repomix configuration to include file patterns that capture valid code files without inadvertently filtering them out.\n\nEstimated Impact: High\nEstimated Effort: Medium",
