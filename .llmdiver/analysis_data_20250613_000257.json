If not, investigate why no valid code files are present.\n2. **Reconfigure File Patterns**: Review and adjust file patterns in the repomix configuration to ensure they accurately capture relevant code files.\n3. **Document Project Details**: Create a project README or documentation to outline the primary language, framework, and any specific requirements or constraints.\n4. **Plan Code Structure**: Develop an initial architecture overview and complexity hotspots analysis to guide future development and refactoring efforts.\n\nEstimated Impact: High\nEstimated Effort: Medium-High\n\nNote: Given the repository's current state, these recommendations focus on addressing potential issues rather than analyzing existing code.",
