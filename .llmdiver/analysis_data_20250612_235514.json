This suggests that the repository may contain only configuration or documentation files, or that the file patterns in the repomix configuration are too restrictive.\n\n## Critical Issues (Priority: CRITICAL)\nNone\n\n## High Priority Concerns (Priority: HIGH)\nNone\n\n## Technical Debt & TODOs (Priority: MEDIUM)\nNone\n\n## Dead Code & Optimization (Priority: LOW)\nNone\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\nGiven the empty repository, the following actions are recommended:\n\n1. **Verify Repository Integrity**: Check if the repository is intentionally empty or if there's an issue with the file patterns in the repomix configuration.\n2. **Add Code Files**: If the repository is intended to contain code, add valid code files and re-run the analysis.\n3. **Update Analysis Instructions**: Review and update the analysis instructions to reflect the actual project context and requirements.\n\nEstimated Impact: High (repository integrity and analysis accuracy)\nEstimated Effort: Low-Medium (depending on the outcome of step 1)\n\nNote: Since there's no valid code for analysis, this report focuses on the repository's state rather than providing in-depth technical recommendations.",
