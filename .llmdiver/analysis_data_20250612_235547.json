If the project is intentionally designed without source code, consider adding placeholder or example code for future development.\n\n## Dead Code & Optimization (Priority: LOW)\nNone\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\n1. **Verify Repository Configuration**:\n\t* Review `.gitignore` and other configuration files to ensure they are correctly set up.\n\t* Verify that no ignore patterns are filtering out code.\n2. **Add Placeholder or Example Code**:\n\t* If the project is intentionally designed without source code, consider adding placeholder or example code for future development.\n3. **Re-evaluate Project Requirements**:\n\t* Assess whether the repository's current state aligns with project goals and requirements.\n\nNote: Given the empty repository, these recommendations focus on resolving the underlying issue rather than addressing specific technical concerns.",
