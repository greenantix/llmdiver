This suggests that the repository may not contain any actual project code or is configured to exclude all code files from analysis.\n\n## Critical Issues (Priority: CRITICAL)\nNone found, as there are no code files to analyze.\n\n## High Priority Concerns (Priority: HIGH)\nNone found, due to lack of code files for analysis.\n\n## Technical Debt & TODOs (Priority: MEDIUM)\nNone found, since there's no code to review for maintainability issues or TODO/FIXME items.\n\n## Dead Code & Optimization (Priority: LOW)\nNo dead code can be identified without actual code files.\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\n1. **Verify Repository Contents**: Ensure the repository contains actual project code and not just configuration or documentation files.\n2. **Review Repomix Configuration**: Check the repomix configuration for file patterns that might be too restrictive, causing all code files to be filtered out.\n3. **Update Analysis Instructions**: Modify analysis instructions to focus on specific languages (if known) and best practices once actual code is identified.\n\n**Estimated Effort:** Low\n\n**Impact:** Medium (potential misdirection of resources if repository contents are not verified)\n\nNote: Without actual code, it's challenging to provide actionable recommendations or prioritize findings. Further investigation into the repository's contents and configuration is necessary to proceed with a comprehensive analysis.",
