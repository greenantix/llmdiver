## How to Run
```sh
# Optional: Configure LM Studio
export LLM_MODEL="meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct"
export LLM_TEMP=0.2

# Run audit:
./run_llm_audit.sh

# Show payload without running:
./run_llm_audit.sh --show-payload

# Or dry run to see payload:
./run_llm_audit.sh --dry

# Check task status:
bash audits/show_task_status.sh
```

## What Was Done
1. Generated smart repo summary with repomix
   - Limited scan to high-signal patterns
   - Added file structure overview
   - Used intelligent output limits (50 lines per section)
2. Processed through LM Studio
   - Standard mode: Issues and tasks analysis
   - Deep mode: Full architectural assessment (120s timeout)
3. Split findings into task files
4. Generated task prompts
5. Created detailed summary reports

## Next Steps
1. Review the audit in ./audits/full_audit.md
2. Use `send_to_claude.sh` with generated prompts
3. Track progress in task files
