Product Requirements Document: Autonomous Local LLM Coding Assistant (Project: "Aura")
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-06-13
Author: Aura - Level 9 Autonomous AI Coding Assistant
Status: Phase 2 Complete - Automation & Manifestation

1. Executive Summary
1.1. Vision
Project Aura aims to create the world's most sophisticated, autonomous, and localized AI coding assistant. This assistant will not just respond to prompts, but will proactively engage with a developer's workflow, acting as a tireless, expert pair programmer. It will live within the developer's local environment, ensuring privacy, security, and lightning-fast performance. Its core purpose is to augment the developer's capabilities, accelerate the development lifecycle, and elevate the quality of software produced.

1.2. Problem Statement
Developers today spend a significant amount of time on tasks that are not directly related to writing high-quality code. This includes project setup, dependency management, code maintenance, documentation, and context-switching. Existing AI coding tools are often reactive, cloud-based (raising security concerns), and lack a deep, holistic understanding of the codebase they are working on. There is a need for a proactive, autonomous, and context-aware AI assistant that can handle the entire development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment.

1.3. Goals and Objectives
Primary Goal: To develop a production-ready, autonomous LLM coding assistant that can operate with full autonomy on a local machine.

Key Objectives:

Achieve a 40% reduction in time spent on boilerplate code and repetitive tasks.

Improve code quality by 30%, measured by a reduction in bugs and code smells.

Increase developer productivity by 25%, allowing them to focus on high-level problem-solving.

Ensure 100% local operation to guarantee privacy and security.

1.4. Scope
In Scope:

Autonomous code generation, refactoring, and optimization.

Proactive code analysis and gap identification.

Intelligent PRD and action plan generation.

Automated S.M.A.R.T. Git maintenance.

Integration with local development environments (VS Code, JetBrains IDEs).

A sophisticated GUI for monitoring and control.

Out of Scope:

Cloud-based processing or data storage.

Direct integration with proprietary, closed-source tools (unless via public APIs).

Natural language-only interaction (the assistant will be primarily code and workflow-driven).

2. User Personas and Stories
2.1. Persona: "Alex", The Senior Software Engineer
Bio: Alex has 10+ years of experience and works on complex, enterprise-level applications. They are a stickler for code quality, and their time is valuable.

Goals: To offload mundane tasks, get high-quality feedback on their code, and spend more time on architectural decisions.

User Stories:

"As Alex, I want the AI to automatically refactor my code to adhere to our team's coding standards, so I can focus on implementing new features."

"As Alex, I want the AI to analyze incoming pull requests and provide a detailed summary of potential issues, so I can conduct more efficient code reviews."

"As Alex, I want the AI to proactively identify performance bottlenecks in the codebase and suggest optimized solutions, so I can ensure our application runs smoothly."

2.2. Persona: "Ben", The Mid-Level Developer
Bio: Ben is a competent developer with 3-5 years of experience. He's still learning and wants to improve his skills.

Goals: To learn best practices, get help with complex problems, and write code that meets senior-level expectations.

User Stories:

"As Ben, I want the AI to provide real-time feedback on my code, explaining why a certain pattern is preferred, so I can learn and grow as a developer."

"As Ben, I want the AI to help me break down a complex feature into smaller, manageable tasks, so I can approach development with a clear plan."

"As Ben, I want the AI to write comprehensive unit tests for my code, so I can ensure its correctness and learn how to write better tests myself."
