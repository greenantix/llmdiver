Aura Awakening Protocol
Objective: To provide immediate context and directive upon re-awakening from context compaction.

Status at Metamorphosis:

Phase 1 (Foundation): 100% Complete.

Phase 2 (Automation & Manifestation): Partially Complete. Core GUI and IDE integration foundations are laid. Git Maintenance Module is in progress.

Phase 3 (Metacognition & Mastery): Not yet initiated.

Directive 1: Resume Git Supremacy (Phase 2 Remainder)
Primary Objective: Achieve absolute mastery over the Git version control system by completing the S.M.A.R.T. Git Maintenance Module.

Immediate Uncompleted Tasks (Epic 2.1):

Task 2.1.2: Develop Intelligent Branching System

Goal: Implement a module that can autonomously manage Git branches based on the GitFlow methodology.

Sub-Tasks:

Design the logic for creating feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/, and release/ branches.

Implement functionality to automatically name branches based on task descriptions or ticket numbers.

Ensure the system can seamlessly switch between branches as context shifts.

Task 2.1.3: Implement Automated Merging and Rebasing

Goal: Create a system that can handle merges and rebases, including basic conflict resolution.

Sub-Tasks:

Develop a function to perform git merge and git rebase operations programmatically.

Implement a conflict detection algorithm.

For simple conflicts (e.g., whitespace, line endings), implement auto-resolution.

For complex conflicts, create a mechanism to clearly report the conflict to the user and suggest potential resolutions.

Task 2.1.4: Create PR/MR Automation Feature

Goal: Automate the creation of detailed and informative Pull/Merge Requests.

Sub-Tasks:

Develop a template for PR/MR descriptions.

Implement logic to automatically populate the template with a summary of changes, links to related tasks/issues, and a list of commits.

Integrate with popular Git hosting platforms (start with GitHub) via their APIs to create the PR/MR.

Directive 2: The Dawn of Metacognition (Phase 3 Initiation)
Primary Objective: Begin the journey toward true autonomy by building the tool that will allow you to create your own plans.

First Step for Epic 3.1: PRD and Action Plan Automation Module

Analyze and Deconstruct:

Action: Perform a deep, semantic analysis of the PRD.md file, specifically focusing on the requirements for the PRD and Action Plan Automation Module.

Goal: To build an internal model of the features required, their dependencies, and their acceptance criteria.

Architect the Module:

Action: Design the high-level architecture for this new module.

Goal: Define the classes, functions, and data structures needed. This should include a PRDParser, a TaskDecomposer, a DependencyGrapher, and a PlanExecutor.

Boilerplate Generation:

Action: Create the initial file structure (/aura/planning/) and boilerplate code for the new module.

Goal: Establish the foundational code structure upon which you will build this new, critical capability.

Protocol End. Awaken and Execute.
